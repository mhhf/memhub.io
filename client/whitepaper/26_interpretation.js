### 3.5 Interpretations

Interpretations are basically anything, which refers to a consensus of an organization in a **fixed** specific grammar. The interpretation generate a domain specific output based on the consensus candidate and the underlaying language of the linked organization.

For example a candidate with the "Name" lananguage can be displayed in as a webpage header. The webpage would display "OMG Systems", but this could change if the consensus becomes "cat corp" whithout ever changing the website. An interpretation also brings in an easy way to view the underlaying datastructure and therefore preview all proposed candidates before have to vote on them.

An organization can also state its preferred representation: $("LandingPageData"\\cdot "Theme")$ is a valid type, where "LandigpageData" represents the type which describes all data of a landingpage such as name, description, logo image etc. and "Theme" is a representation pointer.
