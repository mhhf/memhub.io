### 2.2.3 context
The nonterminals of a grammar can also be interpreted as a named context. This is handy for context based statements such as **contextual delegations**. 

Imagine in our organization with the "WIP Name+Logo" type Alice is aware about her terrible decision making for Logos. Here she can delegate her votes only in the context of \`ImageCtx\` to Charlie. Anyone still can make proposals, but Dave has a voting wight in the context of \`ImageCtx\` of 50%. In another context (like \`ImageDescriptionCtx\`) he still only has his initial voting weight of 10%. 

Also imagine that Bob thinks that at this stage images should't be considered at all. He also likes the name "OMG Systems" so he votes 0.8 for the \`"OMG Systems" ImageDescriptionCtx\`. With this statement all candidates which can be derived out of this context by using the production of the organization will receive his vote. Note that also future coming candidates automatically receives his vote! This is called **contextual voting**.


Lets see how our voting table looks:

|           | ("OMG Systems") | ("cat corp", "Black and White Image")   | ("cat corp" ,![](cat.svg))
----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------
|  Alice    | 0               | 1                                       | 0
|  Bob      | 0.8             | 0.8                                     | 0
|  Charlie  | 1               | 0                                       | 1
|  Dave     | 0               | 0                                       | 1


"OMG Systems": $0.8 * 30 + 1 * 20 = 44$

("cat corp", "Black and White Image"): $1 * 40 + 0.8 * 30 = 62$

("cat corp", ![](cat.svg)): $1 * (10 + 40) + 20 = 70$

Our consensus candidate is therefore the last candidate.
